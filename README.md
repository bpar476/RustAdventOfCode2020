# Advent of Code 2020

For this year's (and my first) advent of code I've decided to do it in rust to gain confidence with the language fundamentals.

To run the solutions, make sure you install and configure [Rust](https://rust-lang.com)

To run one of the solutions, go into the directory for that day and run:

`cargo run .\src\main.rs`

## Disclaimer

Since I'm doing this in my spare time, I haven't taken the time to make the code beautiful. I'm sure there is some duplication
that could be fixed with macros and other structures.
